      <p>
            My name is Geran Vanatta. Since childhood, I have worked on visual art such as drawing, painting, ceramics, print-making, fashion design, and building miniatures. My free time is spent in a creative outlet where I work on personal projects and comission pieces. Although art is my first love, my goal is to have a career in web development. I look forward to obtaining new skills and continuing to expand my forms of creative avenues.
